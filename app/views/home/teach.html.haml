        Features
      %p.uk-width-medium-4-5.uk-container-center.uk-margin-bottom Kudoso Tasks starts with age appropriate "chores", customized for your child that are their responsibility each and every day.  Then you can add to that list parent directed activities like progress on a specific homework project, or practicing a specific sport or instrument based on your child’s activities and interests.  If it’s a measurable behavior that you want to encourage, you can make it part of your child’s Kudoso Tasks.  Once the task list is complete, their rewards (Kudos) are earned and a predetermined amount of screen time is unlocked without you having to do anything.  It teaches independence, responsibility and rewards kids for a job well done!

      %p Kudos are the heart of Kudoso, after all that is where our name comes from! Kudos are a virtual currency that parents use to encourage and direct their children. We built Kudoso to avoid the negative authoritarian style that most parental control apps employ.
      %p
        Specifically, Kudos are earned by kids for not only doing what they have to do, but by doing what we as parents
        %em want
        them to do. Parents can setup Kudoso Tasks which connect to activities provided by Kudoso Connected Partners, such as Kahn Academy and FitBit.  Kids can earn their Kudos by completing these activities or those you deem a priority for your child.
