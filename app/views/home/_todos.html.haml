        ToDos & Chores

      Kudoso teaches kids about work ethic, responsibility and priorities through ToDos.  While it starts
      with "chores", Kudoso ToDos are so much more than chores we had to give it another name!  ToDos provide
      your child with a list of required and optional activities for the day.  The required activities restrict
      any screen time access until they are compete where the optional activities are intended to direct and
      encourage certain behaviors.  Best of all, kids are rewarded for a
      %span.bold
        Job Well Done
      by unlocking their screen time and earning Kudos which they can save up for a rainy day (literally, Kudos
      are great to have on a rainy day to unlock some extra screen time)!
      %h3 Simple Chore Setup
      As a parent, no one wants to spend hours setting up and maintaining chore charts. At Kudoso, we are parents
      and we made it incredibly fast and easy to create and assign chores to your kids. It starts with ToDo Groups:
      these are pre-built, curated lists of age-appropriate chores.  Kudoso has already done the research and
      crearted these great starter sets of chores for your kids that you can assign with a single click.  It
      doesn't get easier that that!  We've even built an extended curated list of age-approprite (but not default)
      chores so if you're stumped trying to think of the right chores for child you can find the inspiration in
      one of ours.
      %h3 Completely Customizable
      There is never a "one size fits all" approach that works with parenting, and importantly Kudoso doesn't
      want to restrict your abilities, we want to enhance them!  That's why Kudoso ToDos are completely customizable.
      Kudoso Todos allow you to create and assign your own ToDos to your kids.  You can edit the default chore
      list to set a schedule that works for your family.  Perhaps you have child with more needs than others, you
      can extend the description to match the vocabulary your child will understand and provide direction unique
      to your family.

      you can add beneficial activities to your child's ToDo list such as "Play outside for 30 minutes" and "Reading
      Exercise at Khan Academy."  You can even reward your kids by awarding them Kudos for completing these
      activities.

        We all know that doing chores help children grow and learn valuable life skills, but time is a precious
        commodity so lets maximize it!  Kudoso will help organize and direct your child's time with minimal effort
        and time commitment from you, their parent.
