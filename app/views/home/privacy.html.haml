      %h2 Information Collected About Website Visitors
      %p Like most websites, Kudoso collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Kudoso's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Kudoso's visitors use its website. From time to time, Kudoso may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      %h2 Types of Information We Collect
      %p
        We collect two basic types of information - personal information and anonymous information - and we may use personal and anonymous information to create a third type of information, aggregate information. We collect the following categories of information:
      %ul

      %h2 Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information
      %p Certain visitors to Kudoso's websites choose to interact with Kudoso in ways that require Kudoso to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Kudoso gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, registered users of Kudoso provide their name, email address, and other information . Those who engage in transactions with Kudoso are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Kudoso collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Kudoso. Kudoso does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Kudoso's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Kudoso will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Kudoso discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Kudoso believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Kudoso, third parties or the public at large.

If you send us a request (for example via a support email), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users.
