      %h3 Unlocking Activities
      %p Kudos can be used by kids to unlock content or even additional screen time. As a parent, you have complete control over what options are available for your kids. By default, kids can unlock up to an additional 1 hour of screen time OR use Kudos to unlock access to a new app/game from a Kudoso Connected Partner (for example, some of the apps are normally paid apps that Kudoso provides as rewards for a Job Well Done).
      %h3 Kudoso Exchange
      %p Parents can use the Kudoso Exchange to setup an exchange "contract" with their children. Just like in real life, kids learn the value of an agreement and how to work mutually with their parents. In the exchange, parents can setup exchanges of Kudos for real merchandise such as the child's allowance. Additionally, through an integration with Amazon.com, kids can search for merchandise that they would like to have and parents can set a value (in Kudos) for that merchandise. Kids can then watch their progress in the Kudoso Bank as they save toward their goal.
      %h3 Kudoso Bank
      %p As a parent our job is to prepare our kids for the future. Kudoso helps in this process by building valuable life skills into your child's daily routine. The Kudoso Bank helps in this process by teaching basic money-handling skills like budgeting, saving and understanding debits and credits. As kids earn Kudos, their bank account reflects this as credits. When they use Kudos, their accounts are debited just like a real bank account. Allowing kids to clearly see their progress toward their goal as they save their Kudoso.
